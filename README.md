# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-for-Image-Generation
A deep learning project that builds a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create realistic images, such as faces or artwork, using datasets like CelebA. Trains a generator and discriminator with TensorFlow/PyTorch, tackling challenges like mode collapse. Ideal for exploring generative AI, data augmentation, and creative applications.
